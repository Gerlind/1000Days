# 1000Days
A new psychtech startup project

Business Idea

We bring real mental wellness to every family’s home with a fresh brise of positivity and humour.
The first 1000 days of a child - from conception to around two years - are fundamentally important for later development in all aspects. Supporting families during this time is direct investment in a healthy and happy future. Second, childbearing is a major transition in a woman's life. Support and caring help can make this transition a smooth and empowering one - preventing or easing many of the usual challenges. 
Via an easy-to-use and well-arranged web portal mothers and fathers to be or with young children find the most important information, online courses, webinars, internetbased coaching or therapy sessions and a handknitted network of professionals in their region. 
The web portal is flanked with a professional enjoyable app and blog and a shop offering only hand selected products. But the core is its innovative approach to providing individualized mental support with novel online therapy tools.

We are currently searching for a Co-Founder CTO (IT Expert) and Co-Founder COO (Marketing Expert) to complement our expertise.

Market
About 700.000 new babys are born each year in Germany. That means about 2 million families are in the founding phase each year – 4 million women and men. Plus, around 2 million women and men having unfulfilled wish of child. And another million with older children also seeking support.
Our users will be heavy digital consumers and have an awareness of psychological issues concerning this phase of life. Our informed guess would be that these days this is true for at least 50%. As a result we calculate with a market of 3.5 million potential clients.

Background

Since 2012 the private praxis „Geburt aus der Mitte“ has been offering psychological oriented services for all issues concerning conception, pregnancy, birth and the first three years of life. We are now a team of three entrepreneurs and mothers with psychological-educational background and offer counseling, birth preparation, hypnosis, doula and childbed services and systemic therapy. 
We now want to bring our business to a new level: Making use of social media, digital opportunities and cutting-edge VR-technology we want to spread our service from Leipzig to the German speaking world. Besides parents, we want to address business companies, health insurances and charitable foundations to promote our services. 

To achieve this we are seeking support from HHL for developing a well-grounded business model and business plan - and hopefully find one ore more co-founders who share our mission and contribute necessary business know how.
